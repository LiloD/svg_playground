## What is d3.js
* D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating `documents based` on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG and CSS.


* D3.js helps you attach your data to `DOM` (Document Object Model) elements. 
Then you can use `CSS3`, `HTML`, and/or `SVG` showcase this data. 
Finally, you can make the data interactive through the use of D3.js `data-driven` transformations and transitions.


* D3.js is a javascript library added to the `front-end` of your web application. 
Your back-end (the server) will generate the necessary data. 
The part of the application the users interact with (the front-end) will use D3.js.
