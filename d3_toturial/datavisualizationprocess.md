# Data Visualization Process

1. Acquire
    *  Obtain the data, whether from a file on a disk or a source over a network

2. Parse
    *  Provide some `structure` for the data's meaning, and order it into `categories`

3. Filter
    *  Remove all but the data of interest

4. Mine
    *  Apply methods from statistics or data mining as a way to `discern patterns` or place the data in mathematical context

5. Represent
    *  Choose a basic visual model, such as a bar graph, list, or tree

6. Refine
    *  Improve the basic representation to make it clearer and more visually engaging

7. Interact
    *  Add methods for manipulating the data or controlling what features are visible
